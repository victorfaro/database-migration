# üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Team Roadmap & Best Practices

This document outlines the essential practices, tools, and processes that the engineering team should adopt to improve reliability, security, onboarding, and productivity. The focus is on standardizing workflows, enhancing security, ensuring code quality, and streamlining release processes.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Git Workflows (Gitflows)

### Importance:
- Standardizes collaboration across team members
- Prevents conflicts and chaos in merging and releases
- Supports CI/CD pipelines efficiently

### Recommendations:
- Use a branching model like **Git Flow** or **Trunk-Based Development**
- Define clear branch types: `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/*`
- Protect `main` and `develop` branches with required reviews and passing CI

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Testing and Code Coverage

### Importance:
- Ensures code reliability and prevents regressions
- Encourages confidence in refactors and contributions
- Helps detect untested or risky areas of code

### Recommendations:
- Enforce unit/integration testing with frameworks relevant to the tech stack (e.g. Jest, Mocha, Pytest)
- Use coverage tools (e.g. Istanbul, Coverage.py)
- Set minimum coverage thresholds (e.g. 80%)
- Include test runs in CI/CD pipelines

---

## 3. ‚ú® Linting and Code Formatting

### Importance:
- Maintains consistent code style across the codebase
- Catches syntax issues and anti-patterns early
- Reduces code review friction and cognitive overhead

### Recommendations:
- Use linters specific to the language stack (e.g. ESLint, Flake8, golangci-lint)
- Use formatters like Prettier, Black, or gofmt for consistent style
- Enforce lint and format checks in CI
- Optionally integrate with pre-commit hooks using tools like Husky or lint-staged

---

## 4. üîê VPN & Security for Analytics and Database

### Importance:
- Prevents exposure of sensitive data and services
- Restricts access to internal tools and data
- Aligns with privacy and compliance best practices

### Recommendations:
- Use a VPN solution (e.g. Tailscale, WireGuard) for accessing internal services
- Migrate analytics dashboards and tools (e.g. Metabase, Superset) behind VPN
- Move databases into private subnets with **access only via VPN**
- Use security groups, firewall rules, and IAM where applicable

---

## 5. üöÄ Onboarding Documentation for Engineering

### Importance:
- Reduces ramp-up time for new hires
- Clarifies team expectations and workflows
- Boosts consistency and confidence in contributions

### Recommendations:
- Create an `onboarding.md` with:
  - Environment setup
  - Access credentials (VPN, repos, dashboards)
  - Repo structure & tooling
  - Common commands, CI, and dev scripts
  - Team contacts and internal links
- Keep it updated with feedback from new joiners

---

## 6. üì¶ Database Change Management (Migrations)

### Importance:
- Tracks schema changes safely and consistently
- Prevents production data issues and drift

### Recommendations:
- Use a migrations tool (e.g. Flyway, Liquibase, Prisma Migrate, Alembic)
- Store migrations in version control alongside app code
- Integrate DB migrations into CI/CD workflows
- Require code reviews for all DDL changes

---

## 7. üìä Dedicated Analytics Database

### Importance:
- Offloads read-heavy queries from production
- Enables deeper data analysis without affecting app performance

### Recommendations:
- Replicate selected production data into an analytics DB (e.g. via CDC tools)
- Use appropriate tools for querying (e.g. BigQuery, ClickHouse, Redshift)
- Govern access via VPN and roles

---

## 8. ü§ñ Automated Release Flow

### Importance:
- Eliminates manual errors in releases
- Creates reproducible and auditable release history

### Recommendations:
- Use SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) across projects
- Auto-increment versions via CI/CD
- Tag and publish releases based on changelogs or commit messages (e.g. Conventional Commits)
- Tools: `semantic-release`, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

---

## 9. üîÅ Secrets Rotation and Management

### Importance:
- Reduces risk of credential leaks or abuse
- Ensures compliance with security policies and standards

### Recommendations:
- Use secret managers (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Doppler)
- Rotate sensitive tokens/keys periodically (e.g. every 90 days)
- Automate secret rotation and injection into environments (CI/CD, runtime)
- Store no secrets in code or public repositories

---

## 10. üì¶ Helm Configuration Consolidation & ArgoCD Deployment

### Importance:
- Centralizes deployment configuration for better maintainability
- Aligns with GitOps best practices for repeatable, reliable deployments

### Recommendations:
- Move all Helm charts and deployment values into `nationgraph-services` repo
- Decommission scattered or per-repo Helm files
- Gradually transition release process to **ArgoCD** for declarative, Git-based deployments
- Create application manifests and sync policies in `nationgraph-services`
- Automate version tag updates with `ApplicationSet` or similar ArgoCD tooling

---

## 11. üìà Instrumentation, Metrics, and Alerting

### Importance:
- Enables visibility into system health and performance
- Detects issues before they impact users
- Supports data-driven engineering decisions

### Recommendations:
- Implement metrics collection via Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog
- Instrument key services for latency, error rate, throughput (RED metrics)
- Define and monitor SLIs/SLOs for critical paths
- Configure alerting with tools like Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Slack integrations
- Include dashboards as part of operational runbooks
