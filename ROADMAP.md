# üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Roadmap & Best Practices

This roadmap outlines strategic initiatives, practices, and tooling to enhance developer experience, system reliability, security, and productivity. Organized into five pillars, this guide serves as the foundation for engineering standards and ongoing improvements.

---

## 1. üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow & Tooling

### Git Workflows
- Adopt **Git Flow** or **Trunk-Based Development**.
- Enforce protected branches (`main`, `develop`), with PR review + CI required.
- Standardize branch naming: `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/*`.

### Testing & Code Coverage
- Enforce unit and integration tests (e.g. Jest, Pytest).
- Integrate code coverage tools (e.g. Istanbul, Coverage.py).
- Set thresholds (e.g. 80%) and include tests in CI.

### Linting & Code Formatting
- Use linters/formatters (e.g. ESLint, Prettier, Black).
- Include in CI and pre-commit hooks (e.g. Husky, lint-staged).

### Autonomous Code Review & Development Agents
- Integrate autonomous agents to assist with:
  - Reviewing PRs based on past behavior and team rules.
  - Bootstrapping features or suggesting improvements.
- Audit AI suggestions for accuracy and security.

### Automated Release Flow
- Use SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) + changelog generation.
- Automate version bumping and tagging (`semantic-release`, GitHub Actions).

---

## 2. üîê Security & Compliance

### Secret Management & Rotation
- Use secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler).
- Enforce 90-day rotation policies.
- Inject secrets automatically in CI/runtime.

### Security Enforcement in Repos
- Run security linting/scanning in all repos:
  - Detect accidental secrets.
  - Enforce secure code patterns.
- Alert on security violations at commit or PR time.

### VPN & Access Restrictions
- Use VPNs (Tailscale, WireGuard) for internal tools.
- Restrict DBs, analytics dashboards to private subnets behind VPN.
- Apply IAM policies and firewall rules.

---

## 3. üöÄ Infrastructure & Deployment

### Helm Configuration Consolidation & GitOps
- Move all Helm charts to the `nationgraph-services` repo.
- Transition deployments to ArgoCD for GitOps.
- Use `ApplicationSet` for version sync automation.

### Database Change Management (Migrations)
- Use tools like Prisma Migrate, Alembic.
- Track schema changes in version control.
- Require PR/code review for DB migrations.

### Probes in Kubernetes Platform Services
- Add readiness/liveness probes across all core app services.
- Ensure probes are used in autoscaling, alerting, and health checks.

---

## 4. üìà Observability & Monitoring

### Instrumentation & Metrics
- Use Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
- RED metrics (request rate, error rate, duration).
- Define SLIs/SLOs for critical systems.

### Alerting & Runbooks
- Configure alerts via PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Slack.
- Maintain service runbooks with linked dashboards.

### Service & Dependency Status Pages
- Publish real-time status pages for:
  - Core app services
  - External dependencies (e.g. Stripe, Auth, DB)
- Include uptime history and incident logs.

---

## 5. üë• Enablement & Onboarding

### Onboarding Documentation
- `onboarding.md` should include:
  - Local environment setup
  - Access credentials, VPN, dashboards
  - Repo structure, CI/CD usage
  - Common dev scripts
  - Internal contact list and links

### Dedicated Analytics DB
- Replicate prod data (via CDC or ETL) to analytics DB (e.g. BigQuery).
- Control access via VPN and roles.

---

## üîÑ Review Process
- Revisit tools and practices **quarterly**.
- Collect feedback and pain points from engineers.
- Focus on simplicity, reliability, and security.
